# SRT Lab - Jailbreak Edition

[![CI](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Overview

SRT Lab is a React single-page application designed as a workbench for FCA/Stellantis ECU modules. It runs entirely client-side, enabling functionalities such as patching VINs, managing immobilizer keys, and communicating over OBD-II via Web Serial. The project aims to provide comprehensive tools for diagnosing, programming, and "jailbreaking" vehicle ECUs, focusing on high-performance SRT, Demon, Hellcat, and Redeye models to unlock features and enhance vehicle customization.

## User Preferences

I prefer iterative development and value clear, concise communication. Please ask before making any major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. I prefer detailed explanations for complex technical decisions. Do not make changes to the `tools/python-bridge/` folder or its contents.

## System Architecture

### Frontend

React SPA built with Vite. All binary processing is client-side via `FileReader` and `Uint8Array`. A `MasterVinContext` tracks the active VIN and per-module status across tabs.

Core processing helpers in `artifacts/srt-lab/src/lib/`:
- `parseModule` — auto-detects and extracts fields from GPEC2A, RFHUB, BCM, 95640, XC2268_RFHUB, ZF_8HP_TCU.
- `crossValidate` — inter-module rule checking, VIN cross-comparison, SEC16/SEC6 verdicts.
- `securityBytes.js` — single source of truth for the three immobilizer-secret writers (BCM SEC16 split + mirrors + legacy flat, RFHUB Gen2 SEC16, PCM SEC6).
- `keyProgWizard.js` — `runKeyProgPatch` (full 3-module wizard) + `runRfhBcmSync` (bidirectional SEC16 sync).
- `crc.js`, `algos.js` — verified CRC primitives + seed-to-key algorithm table.

UI palette: light base `#F4F1EC`, SRT Red `#D32F2F`, black `#1A1A1A`. Fonts: Nunito (body), Righteous (display), JetBrains Mono (hex/data).

### Backend services

- **`artifacts/api-server/`** — Express API. Download counters, module backups, diff reports, Anthropic AI module assistant (stateless one-shot + persistent conversations), `vehicleJobs` + `vehicleJobEvents` persistence, investigation runs.
- **`tools/python-bridge/`** — separate Python package providing a desktop J2534 driver and localhost HTTP daemon for raw CAN PassThru when Web Serial isn't enough. Python deps are managed in isolation from the main build. **Not modified per user preference.**

### `@workspace/uds` library (`lib/uds/`)

Complete ISO 14229-1 UDS TypeScript library, composite pnpm workspace lib:
- `services.ts`, `nrc.ts`, `constants.ts` — full ISO 14229 service / NRC / constants tables.
- `build.ts` — frame builders for every standard service (return `Uint8Array`).
- `parse.ts` — generic + service-specific parsers (RDBI, SecurityAccess, RoutineControl, RequestDownload).
- `dids.ts` — `0xF1xx` ID block + common DID catalog.
- `isotp.ts` — ISO 15765-2 SF/FF/CF/FC encode/decode + `segmentPayload`.
- 54 unit tests in `src/__tests__/uds.test.ts`; README with 5 worked examples.

The BCM frame builder (`artifacts/srt-lab/src/lib/alfaobdMined/udsFrameBuilder.js`) delegates WDBI to `build.writeDataByIdentifier` and routine/reset frames to the matching lib builders.

## Tabs and features

### Module programming
Dedicated tabs for **BCM**, **RFHUB**, **ECM**, **ADCM** — VIN read/write, key programming, module-specific unlocks. SGW-gated VINs auto-route to the J2534 bridge.

### Module Sync (`ModuleSync.jsx`)
Cross-module security-byte sync: `runRfhBcmSync` in either direction, `Repair flat 0x40C9 from split records`, full 3-module `runKeyProgPatch`. The virgin-GPEC2A SEC6 refusal is a `runKeyProgPatch` behavior only — it is not wired into the **SYNC ALL** button. `executeSync('sync-all')` writes PCM SEC6 (`writePcmSec6` / `engWritePcmSec6`) unconditionally onto any canonical-size dump (4 KB 95320, 8 KB 95640), so a virgin GPEC2A simply becomes paired and exports as `PCM_SYNCED`; only a non-canonical buffer size aborts the write.

### UDS Programmer
Universal raw UDS console driving `@workspace/uds` builders.

### Proxi Decoder (read-only)
`ProxiTab` decodes the BCM `0x2023` proxi blob (16 B from `BODY_PN_CONFIG` via `cgwConfig.decodeBcmConfig`) plus the curated `DEnn` family (`DE00`–`DE0C`, 155 fields) sourced from `bcmFeatureCatalog.generated.js`. Upload BCM `.bin` or paste hex (optional `62 DD DD` UDS header strip). Category sidebar + search + grouped rows. No write path until labels are ground-truthed against a real bench dump.

### Data Management
Backups, session logs, module-dump load/auto-detect/VIN patch/hex viewer/virginizer.

### Diagnostics
Live OBD-II scan, bench diagnostics, **FCA Analyzer** (multi-file cross-module audit).

### Advanced Tools
Seed-to-key calculator (iterates `ALGOS`), GPEC/GPEC2A firmware unlocks, **SWARM** CAN bus diagnostics, J2534 raw CAN PassThru, C-FLASH calibration analysis.

### Workflow Orchestration
`WORKFLOW` tab — persistent `vehicleJobs`, unified Module Census, Fix Plan builder with pluggable `SecurityAccessSource`.

### Read-only references
- **CAN Universe** (`canuniverse`) — ~485 deduplicated CAN/OSS automotive projects merged from three upstream lists + curated extras. Generator: `scripts/src/fetch-can-catalogs.mjs`. Strictly catalog — no downloads/executions.
- **Binary Intel** (`binintel`) — hand-curated third-party binary-analysis reports cross-referenced against SRT Lab coverage with COVERED / PARTIAL / GAP tags. First report: VILLAIN intel (unverified). Read-only.
- **Dispatch Coverage** — AlfaOBD routine-ID coverage browser.

### Capabilities added for competitor parity
- **XC2268-class RFHUB parser** (`xc2268Rfhub.js`) — 2019+ internal-flash RFHUB (64 KB).
- **ZF-8HP TCU parser** (`zf8hp.js`) — 845RE / 8HP70 / 8HP90.
- **Mopar radio codes** (`moparRadioCode.js`) — legacy RAQ/REF code derivation.
- **2019+ Dealer Lockout Bypass** (`dealerLockoutBypass.js`) — 5-step state machine surfaced on `RfhubTab`, gated on observed NRC `0x36`/`0x37` + `XC2268_RFHUB` inspector hint (or bench-override checkbox).
- **Radio Codes tab** (`radiocodes`).

### Transponder writer bridge (`KEY WRITER` tab)
`keyWriter/` USB-CDC bridge that hands a single RFHUB slot's chip ID + resolved SEC16 master secret to Xhorse VVDI Mini / Tango writers via Web Serial (with a Simulator fallback for bench dry-runs). `burnSlot()` runs ping → detect → burn → verify with refuse-on-doubt gates (`securityBytes.js`-style: blank SEC16, wrong chip family, id-shape mismatch, or unknown writer all halt before any bytes leave the host). Chip burn only — vehicle pairing still goes through the existing RoutineControl 0x0401 flow on RFHUB tab. Protocol framing matches public VVDI captures but is **unverified**; see `docs/key-writer-bridge.md`.

### Vendored external tools (`artifacts/srt-lab/vendor/`)
Two Windows binaries pre-staged for internal bench use with manifests + READMEs:
- **FCA PROXI Tool v1.2.0.1** (`vendor/fca-proxi/`) — Stellantis PROXI tool. License bypass via Safengine-Shielden DLL sideload (`shfolder.dll`). Activated against HWID `2899614-B9E65D4-73F1D98-D6D5DCB`. Launch with CWD set to the vendor folder.
- **GPEC Unlocker v1.0** (`vendor/gpec-unlocker/`) — WinLicense-protected .NET binary for Continental GPEC2A unlock.

Surfaced via **External Tools tab** (`exttools`) with status / Launch / Reveal-in-Folder backed by `POST /tools/{status,launch,reveal}` on the J2534 bridge. Native PROXI JS module: `src/lib/fcaProxi.js` (parse/serialize/build + 22 Vitest tests).

Reference docs: `artifacts/srt-lab/docs/{fca-proxi-reference,sgw-and-uds-reference,villain-binary-intel,villain-unpack-workflow}.md`. Decompiled Python source: `tools/fca-proxi-extract/src/`.

### VILLAIN `0x27/0x61` algorithm (quarantined)
Candidate in `artifacts/srt-lab/src/lib/_unverified/villain27_61.candidate.js`. Structurally promoted to `src/lib/villain27_61.js` and surfaced in `algos.js` as `villain_0x61`, **gated behind `ENABLE_VILLAIN_0x61` (defaults `false`)** because the embedded S-box is still the identity-permutation placeholder. Flipping the flag before the real 256-byte `FCA_SBox` is substituted will produce keys the ECU rejects with NRC `0x35`. SeedTab picker iterates `ALGOS`, so it appears automatically the moment the flag flips.
